STEP 1
Initialization of Variables:
    Create the boxes array where each element is an array containing two values: 
    the kilometer and weight of a box. Set the total_weight variable to store the overall weight of the located boxes.

STEP 2
Start of Search Loop:
Initiate an infinite while loop.

STEP 3 
User Input:
Prompt the user to input the kilometer and weight for each of the three boxes.
Use the entered data to update the position of each box in the boxes array.

STEP 4
Check Total Weight:
Sum the weights of all located boxes into the total_weight variable.

STEP 5
Search Completion Condition:
Check if the total weight of the located boxes matches the required weight (713 kg).
If the total weight equals 713 kg, the program ends and displays a message indicating that all boxes are found.

STEP 6
Move the Boxes:
If the total weight is not equal to 713 kg, each box "moves" to a new kilometer.
Specific values (e.g., +5 to kilometers and +10 to weight) are added to each element in the boxes array.
